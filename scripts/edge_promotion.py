Some columns are labeled as RF-td_2, RF-td10, RF-ml_1, etc.

td_X refers to a window size of X. For all these networks, the rest of the parameters are the same:
min_lag is 1, max lag is 3, except RF-td 21, which is just regular random forest.

ml_X refers to a set of min_lags/max_lags for each X.
if X = 0; min_lag = 0, max_lag = 1
elif X = 1; min_lag = 0, max_lag = 2
elif X = 2; min_lag = 0, max_lag = 3
elif X = 3; min_lag = 1, max_lag = 2
elif X = 4; min_lag = 1, max_lag = 4
elif X = 5; min_lag = 2, max_lag = 3
